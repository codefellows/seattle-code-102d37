## The Coders Computer

## Developer Tools

Google the following and show students what code resources, tools, and documentation look like:

- Git
- GitHub
- VS Code
- Sublime Text
- Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)

## Linking GitHub and Code Sandbox

Log into your account of Code Sandbox and create a new HTML, CSS, and JS based sandbox.  Walk students through the process of connecting this sandbox to a GitHub repository.  You may need to do this several times to help lock in concepts.

*Note:* if you haven't already linked up your Code Sandbox account to GitHub, doing so in lecture is a good idea - it gives students the idea on how that process works!
