# The Coders Computer - Recap

## Outline
Students will be working from Code Sandbox throughout Code 101 and 102.  Today's demo is a chance for you (and them) to go back over the tools discussed previously (VS Code, Google Chrome, Git/GitHub) and to install or demo them directly.

## Process
- Go through the process of installing VS Code
- Students will not be using VS Code in this course but it's a good idea to show them a real example of a native text editor
- Demo the different pieces of the GitHub dashboard and user interface.  Show as little or as much as students would like/you feel comfortable with.
