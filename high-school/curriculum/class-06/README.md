# Revisions and the Cloud - Git

## Learning Objectives
- Students will build the habit of using version control to share and backup code.
- Students will understand the purpose of small, frequent commits that clearly communicate about changes made.

## New Vocabulary (and Git commands)
- ACP (add, commit, push)
- `add` - stages a file for commit (gets it ready)
- `commit` - locks changes into git tracking history
- `push` - copies the changes from your *local* computer and puts them on in *remote* repository (ie: GitHub)
