## ACP
Using Code Sandbox, show students the basics of the ACP cycle.  Try to only focusing on the following, to avoid confusing students with the process:

- **A**: `add`
- **C**: `commit`
- **P**: `push`

If students are feeling comfortable with these concepts, show them `git status`.  It's the biggest helper `git` tool of all!
