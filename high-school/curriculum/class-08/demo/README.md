# Revisions and the Cloud - Git and GitHub Working Together

## Cloning
Students will not be able to clone their own repositories as they will be using Code Sandbox to manage their code in this course.  That being said, let's show them show the process.

Create a new repository in GitHub and clone it!  ACP back to GitHub!  Show them the process again and again!

## ACP Review
Outside of showcasing the ability to clone a repo, the goal of today's demo is to recap and review the concepts of the ACP cycle.  You may also show how code can be edited directly in the GitHub dashboard but must be `pull`'ed in order to see those changes locally.

For the ACP demo, remember:

Using Code Sandbox, show students the basics of the ACP cycle.  Try to only focusing on the following, to avoid confusing students with the process.

- **A**: `add`
- **C**: `commit`
- **P**: `push`
