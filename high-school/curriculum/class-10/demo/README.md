# Structure Pages with HTML - Mockup to Markup Workshop

## Workshop
Using the suggested wireframe (found in the `/high-school/resources/wireframes` directory), work with students to translate wireframe components into nicely flowing HTML.  Be sure to focus on HTML being the *content* and *structure* of the page.  CSS will style it.

- Start from top left and work to bottom right of the wireframe.
- Show semantic HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>` in your code.

You may also reference the demo code for this build out in the corresponding `index.html` file.
