# Style Pages with CSS - Styling Content

## Outline
Navigate to [Code Sandbox](codesandbox.io) and create a new HTML, CSS, and JS based sandbox.  Using the HTML from the Mockup to Markup workshop from last week, create and `<link>` an external stylesheet to that document.

Navigate back to the [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel), grab a few colors, and apply them as the values to the following properties:

- `background-color`
- `color`
- `border`

Students will be doing the same thing in lab so be sure to focus on flow and process.  To help students visualize CSS, remind them that they use word processors (Microsoft Word, Google Docs) all of the time.  The formatting tools that are available there are also available in CSS...  just with text, not a GUI (graphical user interface).
