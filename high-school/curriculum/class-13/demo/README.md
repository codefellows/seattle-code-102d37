# Style Pages with CSS - Layout Fundamentals

## Outline
Walk students through the build out of a website structure.  You may use the demo code found in `/style.css` to help you do this - or you may build your own.

Focus your discussion and build on structure, not text styling.

Prompt students with the following:
- How do we create boxes that sit next to each other?
- How do we adjust the size of these boxes?
- How do the sizes of these boxes effect other layout components?
