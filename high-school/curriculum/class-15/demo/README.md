# Style Pages with CSS - Mockup to Design Implementation Workshop

## Outline
Finish building out the CSS styling for the website that you have been progressively building.  Depending on your comfort level, it may be a good idea to let students drive this process so that you can try out new techniques in front of them.

You may reference the final HTML and CSS demo code in this folder for reference (or to use directly).
