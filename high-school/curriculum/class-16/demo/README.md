# Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript - Concepts and Syntax Basics

## Outline
It's the first day of Javascript!  Students may or may not of heard of Javascript before.  Do your best to give them a simple, high level, overview of it's history.  You can want to focus the conversation on:

- The name:  JS, JavaScript, ECMAScript, JavaScript **is not** Java
- The current version (iteration) is ES6
- It can be used to build interactive websites, web applications, robots, games, home automation, and more!
- It is a very flexible language, which can sometimes make it tough to learn.

Once you've given students an overview of the language, move the conversation straight into some basics.  Only focus on the key attributes of a few key JS data types:

- string: a piece of text
- number: a number *note: place emphasis on just working with whole numbers (for now)*
- boolean: true / false
