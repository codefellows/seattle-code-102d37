# Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript - Input and Output

## Outline
Describe the purpose of console.log in the development community.

As you do this, talk lightly about how `console.log` works with relation to input and output in programming.  To lead the conversation forward, have students describe and define them based on their own understanding in a class discussion format.

The `input-output.js` demo contains the following pieces to discuss:

- The string of "i log information for the developer" is the input of our `console.log` statement
- `console.log` will process this information and give us a message with a repeat of our provided string in the *developer console*

Upon completion of your input/output discussion, show students how to link their HTML and JS together, with a focus on external stylesheets:

- Inline JS on the HTML:  `<p onClick="doThing()"></p>`
- Inside of a `<script>` tag: `<script> alert('hello world!') </script>`
- Externally linked:  `<script src="app.js"</script>`
