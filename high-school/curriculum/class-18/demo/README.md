# Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript - Changing Content on the Page

## Outline
Using the corresponding demo, open up a new HTML, CSS, and JS sandbox.  Create a simple HTML scaffold and link a JS file to your HTML (right above the closing body tag).

Show students the following methods for accepting input and updating the page or adding user specific behavior:

- `console.log()` - recap
- `document.write()` - takes in a string and writes it to the `<body>`
- `alert()` - in browser pop-up message
- `prompt()` - prompt's the user with a question and accepts the answer as it's input
