## Outline
It's time to talk conditions!  Creating a logical control flow for your application often requires thinking like a programmer.  Talk students through your process in becoming a programmer and what mental hurdles you had to persist through in order to approach problem solving with a programmers mind set.

Focus on `if` and `else` as real world concepts.  Then, move them into code.  For example:

- **If** I learn to program, I can get a good job as a software developer!  **Else**, I won't get to build apps for my favorite tech company.

Review the related `demo/conditions.js` file for sample demo code to help solidify these concepts.
