# Dynamic Web Pages with JavaScript - JS Behavior Workshop

**It's recap day!**

To discuss the main topics from the week, have students lead the process of creating a new HTML, CSS, and JS sandbox.  Have them walk you through linking your HTML and CSS.  Then the HTML and JS.

Then, prompt the students with "someone show me how to":
- create a browser alert
- ask the user a question
- determine if 10 + 10 is equal to 20
- log information to the developer console
