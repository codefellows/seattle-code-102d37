# Programming with Javascript - Variables

## Outline
Students have likely already read about or heard of JavaScript variables.  From a high level perspective, discuss how variables are used to "store some data in the memory of our application for later use".

Focus the lecture discussion elements on the following:
- **variable declaration:** how we create a variable in JavaSript (`let item;`);
- **variable definition:** how we give our variable some data (`let item = 'pencil'`);

Reference the following demo for example code.  You may integrate this as part of the discussion or as a live code along session afterwards.
