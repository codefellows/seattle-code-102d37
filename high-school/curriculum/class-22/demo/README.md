# Programming with Javascript - Expressions

## Outline
Any chunk of code that can be evaluated is an expression.  Start lecture by stating this, then reference back to it as needed to help support the demo and student questions.

Use the corresponding `expressions.js` demo code as a guide.  If you are comfortable with it, ask students to try and verbalize a simple math expression in a group discussion.
