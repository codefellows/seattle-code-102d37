# Programming with Javascript - Functions - Part 1

## Outline
Walk students through the key components of a function.  Use the functions breakdown diagram in [`/high-school/resources/diagrams/anatomy-of-a-fn.png`](/high-school/high-school/resources/diagrams/anatomy-of-a-fn.png) to help explain these components.  

Build this out progressively, step by step, to ensure students understand the core connecting pieces of a function.
