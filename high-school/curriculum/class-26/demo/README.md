# Programming with Javascript - Functions - Part 2

Build a function that will accept user input and concatenate 2 strings together. This should help prepare them for their lab - to build an `add(a, b)` function.

Focus this as a student lead discussion, recapping all of the key components of a function that they have learned thus far.  Now, we just get to make it truly re-usable!

```javascript
function putStringsTogether(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

putStringsTogether('functions ', 'rock!');
```
