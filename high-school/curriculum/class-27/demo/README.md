# Programming with Javascript - While Loops

## Outline
Walk students through the key components of a while loop.  Use the looping overview and while loop slide found in the [Official Code 102 Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1erahQOCumhGKJWar-8NPHNqfK4zoKe0zCtrPCmtUqCc/edit#slide=id.g2accd1c413_1_72) to help explain these components.  

Upon completion, create a sandbox with a simple while loop that will contain a counter starting a 0 and will add 1 to it until it reaches 5.  This is very similar to their lab assignment and should set them up for success.
