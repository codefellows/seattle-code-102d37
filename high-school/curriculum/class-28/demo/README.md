# Programming with Javascript - For Loops

## Outline
Walk students through the key components of a for loop.  Use the loops diagram in [`/high-school/resources/diagrams/loops.png`](/high-school/high-school/resources/diagrams/loops.png) to help explain these components.  

Upon completion, create a sandbox with a simple while loop that will contain a counter starting a 0 and will add 1 to it until it reaches 5.  This is very similar to their lab assignment and should set them up for success.
